<h1>THE RECIPE PAGE</h1>

In this project, I will demonstrate:
- My skills in HTML
- My first GIT skills, using the command line if possible
- Possibly try to include JavaScript in the page
- (Later on:) Create a web app using Python and JavaScript


<h2>Done as of 03/02/2023: </h2>
- Create `index.html` as home page
- Create three `recipes` pages
- Add `images` folder to store images of dishes
