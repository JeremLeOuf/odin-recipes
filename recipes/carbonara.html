    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound Guanciale (pork cheek), diced</li>
        <li>1 package spaghetti (16 ounce)</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>10 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul><br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add guanciale. Cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crispy, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <br><li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain and return to the pot. Let cool, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <br><li>Whisk eggs, 1/2 of the Pecorino Romano cheese, and some black pepper in a bowl until smooth and creamy. Pour egg mixture over pasta, stirring quickly, until creamy and slightly cooled. Stir in guanciale. Top with remaining Pecorino Romano cheese and more black pepper.</li>
